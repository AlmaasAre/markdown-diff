# Markdown-Diff

Markdown-Diff annotates word [diff][]s of [Markdown][] documents for easier review.
It reformats the output of [`wdiff`][] or `git --word-diff` in Markdown, so the changes to a Markdown document can be viewed inline.
It can also summarize commit history of Markdown documents in a Git repository as well as the changes made to them.

## Usage

### Using GNU wdiff

```bash
wdiff old.md new.md | markdown-format-wdiff >changes.md
```

### Using Git

```bash
markdown-git-changes origin/master README.md >changes.md
```


### Viewing the Output

```bash
# use a Markdown preview app, such as Marked
open changes.md

# or, compile it into HTML and view with your web browser
npm -g install marked
marked changes.md >changes.html
open changes.html
```

## An Example

<$ cd example $>

### old.md: Before Revision
```markdown
<$ cat old.md $>
```

### new.md: After Revision
```markdown
<$ cat new.md $>
```

### Unified Diff
Here's a unified diff of the two Markdown documents shown above.  It's very hard to even recognize that there're any differences between the two.
```bash
diff -u old.md new.md
```
```diff
<$ diff -u old.md new.md | tee changes.diff $>
```


### Word Diff
Here's a word diff of them generated by GNU wdiff, which is slightly better for spotting the changes, but still ugly.
```bash
wdiff old.md new.md
```
```markdown
<$ wdiff old.md new.md | tee changes.wdiff $>
```


### Markdown-Diff
Finally, here's the word diff formatted by Markdown-Diff, which displays the changes on top of the actually rendered document, making the review very productive.
```bash
wdiff old.md new.md | markdown-format-wdiff
```
<$ wdiff old.md new.md | ../markdown-format-wdiff | tee changes.md $>
